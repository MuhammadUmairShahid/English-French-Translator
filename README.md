# English-French-Translator
Used LSTM network model to translate English words into French and vice versa. Any language can be translated through this model by just changing the CSV files.The technique used was to get an English word, add an embed layer, use LSTM as encoder, use Repeat Vector, then again use LSTM as decoder, finally use the dense layer and we obtain a French word.
